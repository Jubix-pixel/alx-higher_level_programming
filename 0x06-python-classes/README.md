Object Oriented Programming

In all the programs we wrote till now, we have designed our program around functions i.e. blocks of statements which manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. This is called the object oriented programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques.



Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields. Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. Such functions are called methods of the class. This terminology is important because it helps us to differentiate between functions and variables which are independent and those which belong to a class or object. Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class.



Fields are of two types - they can belong to each instance/object of the class or they can belong to the class itself. They are called instance variables and class variables respectively.



A class is created using the class keyword. The fields and methods of the class are listed in an indented block.
    Requirements

General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')

All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')

All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
